               Board games and card games are something I have always had alot of enjoyment in. Not only do you get to spend some time with friends sometimes you can come across moments that are like puzzles.
               Whether you are playing a cooperative game or a game against each other, strategy is where the fun comes in... especially when it works. When I was younger I played a good amount of chess and started my own chess club,
               and this is where all my experience comes from. Although I did read books on chess trying to get better at it, years away from playing chess has made me pretty rusty. 
               If there is somewhere you would like to jump to you can do that at one of the links below, otherwise I hope you can learn something from a chess noob like me.

                  <h3>Setup And Initial Rules</h3>

                     <p>

                     Chess is a game set up on a board that consists of squares alternating back and forth between two colors. When setting up the board,
                     position the chess board so that the lighter colored square is on the right side of each player. On the second row from each player the smallest pieces called pawns
                     will be set up on each of the eight squares. The closest row to each player, in order will be set up left to right starting with the rook, knight, and then the bishop.
                     After the first three pieces each player will place their queen on the middle square corresponding with that players color, so that the queens of each player are placed in the same column.
                     Place your king on the other middle square and then place your remaining pieces so that they are cemetrical with your left side of the board, starting from the middle, the bishop, knight, and
                     then the rook on the last remaining space.

                     </p>

                     <p>

                        Chess is a turn based game, where players will alternate taking their turns to move pieces around or capture an opponents piece. When moving a piece, with the exception of the knight, 
                        a player may not move a piece past another piece. When capturing an opponents piece move your piece into a square occupied by an opponents piece and set your opponents piece to the side
                        of the board. You may not move a piece into the same square as another piece with the exception of capturing. Chess is a game which will assign a point value with each different piece as a 
                        way to show the worth of a piece. Although they have points assign with the pieces, the game still only has one way to win, and I encourage you not to think about the points of piece, given
                        the circumstances of a boards state, you can still win a game even if you are down several points compared to your opponent.

                     </p>

                  <h3>Rook (Also Known As Castles)</h3>

                     <p>

                        Although they are often refered to as castles, I discourage you to do so, as to prevent you from getting confused with a special move called <em><a href="#SpecialRules">castling</a></em>, which I will go over later.
                        Rooks are a piece that can move as many spaces as it would like vertically or horizontally on the board, as long as all the squares are not being occupied. Although rooks typically won't see much
                        play in the early game, they become very strong in the end game once there are less pieces crowding up the board. Rooks have a point value of 5.

                     </p>

                  <h3>Knight (Also Known As Horses)</h3>

                     <p>

                           Knights can often be refered to as horses by players who don't know the game very well, and can also be a good way of explaining how they move. Knights are the only piece that
                           can jump over pieces. This means that they can be strong in a <em>closed</em> game, meaning a game where not very many pieces have been captured yet. Knights move in a shape of an "L",
                           moving two spaces, or squares, in a horizontal or vertical manner and one space in the other manner. Because these pieces can jump over pieces you do not need to worry about any spaces
                           in between or any pieces that it could run into. Knights are considered to have 3 points.

                     </p>

                  <h3>Bishop (Also Known As That Pointed Piece)</h3>

                     <p>

                        I have never heard the bishop refered to as "that pointed piece" but I felt they needed a nick-name just like the others. Bishops move as many spaces as they would like in a diagonal direction given
                        all spaces in between are not being occupied. Just like rooks, they are very strong in an <em>open</em> game, meaning a game where there are alot of available spaces to move and a game
                        where many trades have happened already. Bishops have 3 points just like knights. They are considered to be equal in points but depending on whether its a open or closed game, one can prove
                        to be more useful than the other.

                     </p>

                  <h3>Queen (Also Known As The Best Piece)</h3>

                     <p>

                        Anyone that has played chess a decent amount know that the queen is a very powerful piece, but it is considered unwise to move the queen out onto the board too quickly. While you are stuck
                        moving your queen around to protect her from from your opponents threats, your opponent is able to get many pieces out onto the board and is given more time to set up an attack. Queens can move in
                        the same way as both the rook and the bishop combined, and so she recieves the combined point total of 8.

                     </p>

                  <h3>King (Also Known As The Most Important Piece)</h3>

                     <p>

                        Although the King is the most important piece they are not very strong. A king can only be moved one square at a time in any direction he wishes. In a game of chess, it is important to keep your king
                        in a safe area, the king is to be protected at all costs, and you lose the game if your king is captured. The king does not have a point value.

                     </p>

                  <h3>Pawn (In Their Own Way, Are Also The Best Piece)</h3>

                     <p>

                        Although pawns can be considered easily disposable, pawns become very important pieces in the end game. On their very first move, they can be moved two squares forward, after that they are restricted
                        to moving only one space forward (vertically) and cannot be moved in any other direction. Unlike other pieces, pawns capture differently than how they are moved. Every other piece can capture any piece they can move to,
                        for pawns, they can only capture one space diagonally forward. Pawns have a special rule attached to them however, once a pawn has moved across the board to the last row on the opponent's side of the board,
                        they can be <em>promoted</em> to any other piece (besides the king). This means that a pawn will become any other piece that the player chooses, most commonly, they become another queen. Pawns have another special rule, less
                        commonly known, called "<em><a href="#SpecialRules">en passant</a></em>", but I'll go over this later. Pawn's have a point value of one.

                     </p>

               <h2><a id="HowToWin">How To Win The Game</a></h2>

                  <p>

                     As I have already said, there is a point system in chess, but that is not what decides whether you win a certain game or not. Points are more used to determine the worth of a piece and to determine how far down a person
                     is in comparison their opponent. To win the game of chess, you must check-mate your opponents king. Check-mating means to threaten to capture an opponents king, and the opponent has no moves to stop the capture,
                     for example, the opponent can't take the piece threatening the capture, can't move the king to any safe square, or block the capture of their king with the use of another piece. When a piece threatens to capture
                     the opponents king, but their are still playable moves, this is considered a "check". Putting someone in check is a forcing move, that forces your oppenent to make certain moves they may not want to do, to avoid capture,
                     and can be an effective way of gaining an advantage against your opponent.

                  <h3>Castling</h3>

                  <p>

                     An important rule to remember is castling. Castling is a move that helps to ensure the safety of your king. To castle a player moves their king two spaces to their left or right, and they put the rook from the edge they moved
                     their king towards and puts that rook on the other side of their king. This helps to both get your king into a safer position as well as it helps to, develop, or to bring your rook into play. There are a few rules to keep in 
                     mind when castling though. First off, your king and the rook you are going to castle with cannot have moved once before doing so, and when castling you cannot use it to move out of check, and can't move through check
                     when doing so, meaning if a square your king moves to or through while castling would out you in check you cannot play the move. When playing chess it is recommended to castle early in the game to keep your king in a safe position.

                  </p>

                  <h3>En Passant</h3>

                  <p>

                     When chess was originally played pawns were unable to move two squares on their first move, this was a rule that was added into the game later on. People thought that pawns moving only one space at a time made the game
                     slow, at least in the beginning of the game, so it was decided to allow pawns on their first move only, they could move two spaces. Then there would be situations where people would get frustrated because if they had their pawn close to
                     oppenents pawn, people were able to pass by other pawns by moving two spaces forward. This is when the rule "en passant" was created. "En passant" is french for "in Passing". On a turn where a pawn would pass an opponents pawn by moving two
                     spaces forward, then the opponent, for one turn only, has the chance to capture the pawn as if it only moved one space forward. If they choose not to play en passant, then they lose the chance to take the pawn as if it had only moved
                     one space.

               <h2><a id="Opening">Opening</a></h2>

               <p>

                  Now that we have learned the rules of the chess, we can get to the fun part, strategy! There are alot of ways you can start off a game of chess, and there is no wrong or right way. When starting a game of chess, keeping control of the center of the board is your main goal.
                  When you start to put pieces in the center of the board, your pieces are able to "control", or cover more squares then they would be able to if they were stuck on the back row, this is called developing your pieces. Getting your pieces in a position that allows them to cover more
                  squares at once, while still protecting your own pieces is the key to a good opening in chess. There are a couple of sneaky checkmates you can give to your opponent really early in game, and ones you should be aware of as well, to better protect against it yourself. One is called
                  the scholor's mate, while another one is called the fool's mate. Something to also keep in mind, if you ever really start getting into chess, there are so many good openings that have been studied for awhile in the game of chess and it is recommended to learn an opening or two And
                  to learn what to do in certain situations. These you can find online.

               </p>

                  <h3>The Fools Mate</h3>

                  <p>

                  The fools mate, well that is just as it says. Not something you will see happen very often, this is a checkmate that can happen in just two moves. Sounds impressive until you realize that to do this check-mate your opponent has to help you to checkmate him. First your opponent will move his
                  pawn in front of his king side bishop up one, while

               <h2><a id="MidGame">Mid-Game</a></h2>

               <p>

                  The mid-game is where all the skill really shows. You need to do your best to keep trying of what pieces are still being covered and what your opponents weaknesses are. Alot of the getting better will just take practice, but I can give you a few pointers on what to look for,
                  and I'll tell you a couple of rules I've made to myself. Even if it looks far off, always keep your mind on the goal, to check-mate the enemy king. Don't get too sucked away from trying to take as many pieces as possible, although trading pieces off can be a valid strategy, always
                  return to "can I check-mate the enemy or can I set it up in a couple of moves?". Keep yourself focused on the main goal and being aware of what your opponent is trying to do is the key to success.
